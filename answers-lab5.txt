Questions:

1. We do not have to do anything else to ensure taht this I/O privilege setting
   is maintained. This is because when we switch from user mode to kernel mode
   we make sure to push all the CPUs registers, including the EFLAGS register
   with the bits that we modified, onto the TSS. When we go back to the file
   system's environment, we restore the EFLAGS, with the proper FL_IOPL_3 bits
   set. If we switch environments, we recover another environments' EFLAGS,
  which will not be set to FL_IOPL_3.
